# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security
Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/lpradel/steam-web-api-java/security/advisories/new) tab
with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known,
mitigations for the issue. This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.

## Security/Bugfix Versions

Security and bug fixes are generally provided only for the latest minor version.
Fixes are released either as part of the next minor version or as an on-demand patch version.

Security fixes are given priority and might be enough to cause a new version to be released.
